# ML Based Intrusion Detection System

A Flask-based Python application for intrusion detection using machine learning models. The system analyzes network activity to predict whether it is benign or malicious.

## Features

- Utilizes machine learning models (Random Forest, Decision Tree, SVM, KNN) for intrusion detection.
- Predicts the likelihood of an attack based on input data.
- Sends email alerts for detected attacks.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
`git clone https://github.com/yourusername/intrusion-detection-flask.git`

2.Install the required dependencies:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
